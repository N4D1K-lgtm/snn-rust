# `simulation.rs`

In the `simulation.rs` module, you will define the `Simulation` struct that manages the simulation of the SNN, including the network state, simulation parameters, and the time step. You will also implement methods for initializing the simulation, updating the network state at each time step, and recording the simulation results (e.g., spike times, neuron states, synaptic weights).

Example:

rust

```rust
pub struct Simulation {
    network: Network,       // The spiking neural network
    time_step: f64,         // The simulation time step (e.g., in milliseconds)
    duration: f64,          // The total duration of the simulation
    // Other parameters and state variables as needed
}

impl Simulation {
    pub fn new(network: Network, time_step: f64, duration: f64) -> Self {
        // Initialize the simulation struct
    }

    pub fn run(&mut self) {
        // Loop through time steps, updating the network state and recording results
    }

    // Additional methods for recording results or setting parameters, if needed
}
```

Include utility functions for setting simulation parameters (e.g., duration, time step, recording options) and running the simulation.
