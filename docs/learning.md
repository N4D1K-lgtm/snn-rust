# `learning.rs`

In the `learning.rs` module, you will define the `LearningRule` trait and implement various learning rules as structs. The `LearningRule` trait should outline the common interface for learning rules, including methods for updating synaptic weights based on pre- and post-synaptic activity.

Example:

rust

```rust
pub trait LearningRule {
    fn update_weights(&mut self, pre_spike: bool, post_spike: bool, dt: f64);
}

pub struct STDP {
    // Parameters and state variables specific to this model
}

impl STDP {
    // Additional methods specific to this model, if any
}

impl LearningRule for STDP {
    // Implement the LearningRule trait methods for STDP
}

// Implement similar structs and impl blocks for RSTDP and HomeostaticPlasticity models.
```

Integrate learning rules with the synapse module, allowing users to specify the learning rule when creating synaptic connections. You can achieve this integration by having a reference to a `LearningRule` instance in the synapse struct, and calling the relevant learning rule methods when updating weights or transmitting spikes.
