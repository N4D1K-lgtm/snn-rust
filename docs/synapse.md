 # `synapse.rs`

In the `synapse.rs` module, you will define the `Synapse` trait and implement various synapse models as structs. The `Synapse` trait should outline the common interface for all synapse models, including methods for updating synaptic weights and transmitting spikes.

Example:

rust

```rust
pub trait Synapse {
    fn update_weight(&mut self, pre_spike: bool, post_spike: bool, dt: f64);
    fn transmit_spike(&self) -> f64;
}

pub struct StaticSynapse {
    // Parameters and state variables specific to this model
}

impl StaticSynapse {
    // Additional methods specific to this model, if any
}

impl Synapse for StaticSynapse {
    // Implement the Synapse trait methods for StaticSynapse
}

// Implement similar structs and impl blocks for STDP and VoltageDependentPlasticity models.
```

The `synapse.rs` module should also include functions for creating and managing synaptic connections between neuron populations, specifying the connection patterns and synaptic weights. These functions can be implemented as methods or associated functions of the structs or as standalone functions in the module.
